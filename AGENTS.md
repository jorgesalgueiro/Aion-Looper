# Aion-Looper quality gate

The user requires one feature at a time: implement, compare, test, fix and retest;
only continue to another feature when the current feature is as good as or better
than the unchanged Ascii-Looper behavior. Passing state/UI tests does not prove
sound parity. Preserve original interface and functionality; new UI is limited
to needed native audio/input/MIDI configuration using the original style.

Latest accepted work: native capture/overdub finalization, ordered frontend
performance commands, the original NORM action (including its no-op envelope
repair) and the loop Rvers control. Offline DSP and connected
committed-PCM gates pass for their documented scope. Full browser/driver parity
is not established. Each subsequent feature must independently pass the gates
below before another feature starts; keep any newly failing feature under repair.

Before advancing:

1. Run unchanged-JS comparisons for state and DSP and the live core audio audit.
2. Integrate bounded ownership transfer/finalization without full-buffer work,
   allocations or locks on the audio callback. Preserve old PCM on failed edits.
3. Test empty/short/long clips, stereo and mono, offsets/wraps, feedback/replacement,
   cancellation/clear/stop/reset and memory exhaustion. Exercise 64/128 blocks.
4. Run meaningful Windows and Ubuntu regressions and native bridge checks when
   changed. Document precisely which behavior was compared and which was not.
5. Do not loosen tolerances, remove a failing case or change preserved JS to make
   a gate pass. When extending a fixture to include more of the reference pipeline,
   retain the old regression coverage at its appropriate kernel/component layer.
6. Do not mark the feature complete or start another feature while its acceptance
   fails. Keep working on that feature. Do not label a build production-ready on
   the strength of unit tests; driver/DAW/platform validation is separate work.

The native audio diagnostic and connected NORM comparison are hard acceptance gates. It now compares the
connected manual capture/finalization pipeline; the old raw-mixer regression is
retained in the kernel comparison. Do not infer full-feature or hardware parity
from the committed-PCM subset. See docs/REFERENCE_AUDIT.md for current limits.


Build cadence: use incremental core tests and the existing standalone binary by
default. The user explicitly requests the minimum packages needed for testing;
do not routinely bump versions or generate ZIPs for each feature/bug fix. Preserve
the existing interface. A reproduced acceptance failure takes priority over new
features even if a previous narrower comparison passed.
